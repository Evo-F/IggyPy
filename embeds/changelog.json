New visitors to the Crusader Gaming Hub will now verify in custom, private verification channels in the server itself - previously, this took place in the user's DMs.\n\nThe actual verification system itself has been replaced with live-updating embeds, to make the process much more seamless and less cluttered. \n\nOnce a user's verification session is complete, their verification channel will be automatically deleted. This way, you can see at a glance how many verification \"sessions\" are currently active. All E-Board members also have access ot these verification channels, so if a user gets stuck, you can swoop in to help them!"

Former Students may verify with their college email address if they have access to it - otherwise, they may request manual verification from the moderators. Prospective Students and Guests will require manual verification. \n\nRequests for manual verification will be sent in the Member Log."
