# Quick reminder of verification stages
# Stage 0 - User has just joined CGH.
# User is prompted to react on the menu to declare what group they are in (Student, Guest, etc.)
# Available groups are: Student, Prospective, Guest, Alumnus/Alumna
# Stage 1 - User has selected Student and must now select their class year.
# Stage 2 - User has selected their class year and we are now waiting for them to provide their email address.
# Stage 3 - User has provided a valid email address, and we are now waiting for them to provide the security code.
# User may also opt to re-send verification code if they have not received one.
# User may also opt to return to Stage 2 and re-enter their email.
# Stage 4 - User has selected Guest and is now waiting for an approval/denial.
# Stage 5 - User has selected Prospective and must now enter their full name to continue.
# Stage 6 - User has selected Alumnus/Alumna and must now select their year of graduation.
# Stage 7 - User has selected their class year and we are now waiting for them to provide their email address.
# User may also react here to indicate they do not have access to their Holy Cross email address.
# This will prompt moderators to perform a manual verification.
# Stage 8 - User provided a valid email address and we are now waiting for them to provide the security code.
# See notes for stage 3.
# Stage 9 - This is the "success" generic stage. It occurs in the following cases:
# STUDENT - User verified a valid student email address.
# ALUM - User verified a valid email address OR otherwise proved they are an alum.
# GUEST - User's guest pass request was approved.
# PROSPECTIVE - User entered their full name.
